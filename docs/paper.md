## Summary

**NLP4EDU** is a standalone desktop application that provides a graphical user interface for common Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations. Packaged as a simple executable file, it allows users to import tabular data (CSV) and apply a sequence of text analysis tasks without writing any code. The results, including processed data tables and visualizations, can be directly previewed and exported. The software is built with a Python backend (using libraries such as spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, and BERTopic) and a modern React frontend, connected via `pywebview`. This architecture ensures both powerful analytical capabilities and a responsive, user-friendly experience.

## Statement of Need

In many academic fields, particularly within the educational and social sciences, researchers often work with textual data from surveys, interviews, or learning platforms. While powerful NLP methods exist for analyzing this data, their application typically requires significant programming expertise, creating a barrier to entry for many domain experts. **NLP4EDU** addresses this gap by providing an accessible, low-code solution that empowers researchers to conduct sophisticated text analysis.

The primary goal of **NLP4EDU** is to make established NLP techniques readily available to users regardless of their coding proficiency. The intuitive interface guides the user through loading data, selecting and configuring operations, and interpreting the output. This lowers the technical threshold for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction.

Furthermore, the software is designed for extensibility. The modular architecture, with a clear separation between the frontend and backend, allows developers to easily add new NLP operations or data visualizations. Each operation is a self-contained module that can be registered with the main application, making it straightforward to expand the toolkit for new research questions or to integrate domain-specific models. This design philosophy ensures that **NLP4EDU** can evolve with the needs of the research community it serves.

## Functionalities

The toolbox offers a range of core NLP functionalities that can be chained together into pipelines:

* **Data Preparation**: Cleans text by converting to lowercase, removing stopwords and punctuation, and performing lemmatization using `spaCy` models.
* **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies the most frequent and significant terms in a text corpus.
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Assigns a sentiment score (positive/negative) to texts using pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers.
* **Text Similarity**: Calculates the cosine similarity between text entries using sentence-transformer embeddings to find semantic likeness.
* **Word List Scan**: Scans text for the presence and frequency of user-defined keywords or regular expressions.
* **BERTopic Modeling**: Discovers latent topics in documents using `BERTopic`, providing interactive visualizations of the topic structures.

Each operation is configurable, allowing users to specify parameters such as the text column to be analyzed, language models to use, or the number of keywords to extract.
